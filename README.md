Toxic Bonto
===========


Mini-game created during the [BBQ game jam 2013](http://bbq.extra-coin.fr/index_en.html).

The theme was imposed, the game have to have a vague link with [the Schr√∂dinger's cat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat). 

It also have to have a simple gameplay, a gaming phase should not exceed 10s. All the creation will soon be released in a wario-ware like game.


This is the game my team and I developed. [Play it!](http://platane.github.io/toxic-bonto/)
